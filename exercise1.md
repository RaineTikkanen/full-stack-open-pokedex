I'm going to use Java as an example language for this exercise. For linting and static analysis there are several tools such as Checkstyle, SpotBugs and SonarLint. They help detect code style issues, potential bugs, and violations of coding conventions. For testing, there are JUnit for unit testing and with Mockito for mocking dependencies. Integration and end-to-end tests can be run using frameworks like TestNG. The build process is usually handled by Maven or Gradle, which manage dependencies and compile the code to a runnable application.

While Jenkins and GitHub Actions are widely used, there are several alternatives for CI/CD. GitLab CI/CD offers similar functionality for GitLab repositories as GitHub Actions offers for GitHub repositories. CircleCI and Travis CI provide cloud-based pipelines that are easy to configure and scale. TeamCity and Bamboo from Atlassian are also reliable options, especially for enterprises needing advanced features and integrations.

Choosing between a self-hosted or cloud-based setup depends on factors like security requirements, budget, and infrastructure. A cloud-based CI system offers convenience, scalability, and less maintenance, which is ideal for small teams. However, a self-hosted setup may be preferred if the codebase is sensitive or must comply with internal security policies.
